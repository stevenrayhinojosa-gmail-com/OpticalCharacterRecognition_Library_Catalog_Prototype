# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Library Catalog Prototype
In this project, the objective is to assist a wealthy individual in digitizing and efficiently searching through his extensive home library. The library consists of diverse content, including fiction books, work-related documents, and a substantial collection of bird-watching books. The client envisions an application inspired by Google Book Search, utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on scanned images to enable seamless searching of the entire library.

Project Overview:
Client Requirement:

The client, a book enthusiast with a diverse library, desires a digital solution to organize and search through his collection.
Inspired by Google Book Search, the client specifically envisions employing OCR to convert scanned book images into searchable text.
Application Prototype:

A front-end prototype is developed using a web frontend framework to provide the client with a visual representation of the envisioned application.
The prototype aims to illustrate the user interface and basic functionality, allowing the client to envision the look and feel of the app.
Library Categorization:

The library is categorized into three main sections: fiction, documents, and bird-watching books.
Each category is assigned a unique identifier (1 for fiction, 2 for documents, and 3 for bird-watching books).
User Interaction:

The prototype includes a simple user interface where the client can interactively select a category of interest (fiction, documents, or bird-watching books) using numerical input.
Dynamic Display:

Upon user input, the prototype dynamically displays the corresponding collection based on the selected category.
For instance, if the user requests documents (input 2), the application responds by showcasing the document collection.
