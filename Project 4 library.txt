#A rich man wants to digitize and search his home library and he would like you to develop an
application for him. He has fiction books, documents from his work as well as a large collection
of books about his favourite subject, bird watching.
One inspiration he has is Google Book Search. That uses scanned images with Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) to allow books to be searched.
Develop a simple front end prototype using any web frontend framework that the rich man can
use to imagine what the app would look like.

library1 = {'fiction':1, 'document':2, 'birds':3}
for item in library1:
    print(item)
while True:
    
    request = int(input("which item would you like, fiction, document, birds? "))
    
    if request == 2:
        print ("here is your document collection:")
    
    elif request == 1:
        print('here is your fiction collection')
        
    else:
        print('here is your birds collection')
